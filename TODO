NEED
    -CSS responsive design for mobile (probably not for tablets)
    -Access control - destruction and creation should either be A) limited to certain users or B) Well controlled and sanitized, decide and go for it
    -Verify everything is functional
        -Update page is currently not functional due to image addition, fix this
        -verify error handling is done in a somewhat useful manner, (DO NOT crash the entire server for a single upload error)

Nice to have
    -Improve design as I go, I would have liked to focus on this more, but was a bit overwhelmed with learning a bunch of new information
        -Verify image inputs
        -Verify/Sanitized text inputs
