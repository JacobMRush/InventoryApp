NEED
-CSS responsive design for mobile (probably not for tablets)
-Verify everything is functional
-verify error handling is done in a somewhat useful manner, (DO NOT crash the entire server for a single upload error)
-Verify/Sanitized text inputs
-Access control - destruction and creation should either be A) limited to certain users or B) Well controlled and sanitized, decide and go for it
-Improve design as I go, I would have liked to focus on this more, but was a bit overwhelmed with learning a bunch of new information

-Homepage design seems acceptable, should add responsiveness
-Update page design seems off, also needs responsiveness
-Create page seems functional, needs responsiveness
-Categories page seems not useful, maybe add a sidebar on main page with category filters? and add an authorization section for nav bar

Completed

- Update page is currently not functional due to image addition, fix this
- Verify image inputs (did but not fully since I plan on putting image uploads behind a login)
